# Geometry10

This is my first project written in my first language (Pascal doesn't count). I made it in 10th grade to automate my geometry homework.

The code is quite ugly, but it compiles with only 3 warnings and even works.

    clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o do_some_geometry_for_me
    ./do_some_geometry_for_me
